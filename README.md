# Dimensions - Halite 3 Design

This is a typescript implementation of the [Halite 3 AI competition](https://halite.io) using the [Dimensions AI competition framework](https://github.com/stonet2000/dimensions)

You can run any bot that adheres to the starter-kits provided or use any bot from the actual halite 3 competiton

This will simulate the original halite 3 game quite closely, including features such as inspiration, mining, dropoffs and more.

There are only a few features left out (that I know of at least). Error logs are not saved anywhere at this time, they are only printed to console if you set logging to a level of `Logger.LEVEL.WARN` or higher

Replays are automatically saved to the `./replays` folder. To watch them, you can upload them to the online Halite 3 client at [https://2018.halite.io/watch-games](https://2018.halite.io/watch-games)
